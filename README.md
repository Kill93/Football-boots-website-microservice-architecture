# Football-boots-website-microservice-architecture
I built this application in a microservice style architecture. I had 4 servers built on NodeJS with restful API's. These microservices were connected to a mySQL database. My frontend was build on VueJS and directly accessed these API's. Customer can browse boots collection, add to cart and finally checkout their cart with payments fully set up with Stripe. Admin is able to upload and delete boots from product list, along with viewing all payments completed by customers.

Hosted on Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PWS) with associated mySQL database.
